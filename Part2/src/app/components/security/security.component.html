      <h2>Why Security Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Security and privacy are critical aspects of any inventory management system. These systems handle sensitive business data including pricing information, supplier details, stock levels, and potentially customer information. A security breach could lead to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Financial losses due to stolen pricing strategies or supplier information</li>
        <li>Competitive disadvantage if inventory data is exposed to competitors</li>
        <li>Legal liabilities from data protection regulation violations</li>
        <li>Damage to business reputation and customer trust</li>
        <li>Operational disruptions from system compromises</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This page outlines the key security and privacy requirements that should be implemented in a production inventory management system.

    <h2>Mobile-Specific Security Considerations</h2>
    <div class="mobile-security-card">
      <p>
        When deploying inventory management systems on mobile devices, additional security measures are necessary:
      </p>
      <div class="mobile-points">
        <div class="mobile-point">
          <strong>📱 Device Security:</strong>
          <p>Implement device authentication (biometrics, PINs) and detect rooted/jailbroken devices.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mobile-point">
          <strong>🔗 Network Security:</strong>
          <p>Use VPN for remote access and implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mobile-point">
          <strong>💾 Local Data Storage:</strong>
          <p>Encrypt any data stored locally on mobile devices and implement secure deletion when data is no longer needed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mobile-point">
          <strong>🔒 App Security:</strong>
          <p>Implement code obfuscation, runtime application self-protection (RASP), and regular security updates through app stores.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="compliance-section">
    <h2>Regulatory Compliance</h2>
    <div class="compliance-content">
      <p>
        Depending on your location and industry, your inventory management system may need to comply with various regulations:
      </p>
      <div class="compliance-list">
        <div class="compliance-item">
          <h4>GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)</h4>
          <p>EU regulation requiring protection of personal data, right to access, right to deletion, and data breach notifications.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="compliance-item">
          <h4>CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)</h4>
          <p>California law giving consumers rights over their personal information collected by businesses.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="compliance-item">
          <h4>SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)</h4>
          <p>US regulation requiring accurate financial records and internal controls for public companies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="compliance-item">
          <h4>PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)</h4>
          <p>Required if processing, storing, or transmitting credit card information.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="conclusion-section">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      Security and privacy should be integrated into every phase of the inventory management system development lifecycle, from design to deployment and maintenance. By implementing these security measures, organizations can protect their sensitive business data, maintain customer trust, ensure regulatory compliance, and minimize the risk of costly security breaches.
    </p>
    <p class="emphasis">
      Remember: Security is not a one-time implementation but an ongoing process that requires continuous monitoring, updating, and improvement.
